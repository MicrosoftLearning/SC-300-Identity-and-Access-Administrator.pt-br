# Lab 04: Restore a deleted user

## Lab scenario

It may happen that an account is deleted and then needs to be recovered. You need to verify you can recover an account that has been deleted recently.

#### Estimated time: 5 minutes

### Exercise 1 - Remove a user from Azure Active Directory

#### Task 1 - Remove a User

1. Browse to [https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview]( https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).

2. In the left navigation, under **Manage**, select **Users**.

3. In the **Users** list, select the check box for a user that will be deleted. For example, select **Chris Green**.

    **Tip** - Selecting users from the list allows you to manage multiple users at the same time. If you select the user, to open that userâ€™s blade, you will only be managing that individual user.
